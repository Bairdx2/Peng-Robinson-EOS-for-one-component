# Peng-Robinson-EOS-for-one-componenet

#### This project is a Matlab implementation of the Peng Robinson equation of state (EOS) to gain a better understanding of pure components from a theoretical standpoint and then compare them with experimental data found from NIST.

This project can do the following:
- Calculate and plot the saturation pressure from the triple point to the critical point
- Calculate the saturated liquid density from the triple point to the critical point
- Calculate the enthalpy of the saturated liquid and vapor from the triple point to the critical point
